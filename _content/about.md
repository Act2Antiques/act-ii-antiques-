title: Our Story
paragraph_1: 'Act II Antiques was founded on a simple belief: that beautiful objects deserve to be cherished across generations. Every piece in our collection has lived a life before finding its way to us, and we take pride in helping each item find its next chapter.'
paragraph_2: Our passion for antiques began decades ago, sparked by the discovery of a Victorian pocket watch at a local estate sale. That single find ignited a lifelong journey of seeking out remarkable pieces with stories to tell.
paragraph_3: Today, we travel throughout the country visiting estate sales, auctions, and private collections to source only the finest antiques.
